# Eureka Health Assistant üß†üè•  
An AI-powered, modular healthcare assistant designed to enhance accessibility, streamline hospital operations, and support intelligent symptom analysis.

## Overview  
Eureka Health Assistant is a multi-component digital health project developed for educational and practical use in clinical and low-resource settings. It integrates three core modules:

1. **Voice Assistant** ‚Äì Enables natural interaction via speech for health queries and basic commands.  
2. **Hospital Management System** ‚Äì Facilitates patient, doctor, and appointment management using Excel-based data storage.  
3. **Symptom Checker** ‚Äì Leverages language models and semantic search to analyze user symptoms and generate structured diagnostic insights.

## Project Goals  
- Improve access to medical information for elderly, low-literacy, and visually impaired users.  
- Provide lightweight hospital management tools for small clinics and underserved regions.  
- Support medical education through AI-assisted symptom analysis and decision-making.  
- Demonstrate practical integration of NLP, voice processing, and structured data management in healthcare.

## Real-World Use Cases  
- Rural clinics with limited infrastructure  
- Psychological counseling centers for initial triage  
- Health apps for elderly populations  
- Medical education and student training  
- Remote or underserved healthcare environments
